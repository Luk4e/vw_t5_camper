# Volkswagen T5 Caravelle camperization
This is not a code repo but a place where I share my VW T5 camperization project. I'm sharing this to help others who are looking for solutions to modify the interior of a VW T5.

This is the link to my SketchUp project. I know I haven't added all the details yet, but it's a start and might provide inspiration for others who are trying to arrange the inside of their van.
This project maintains the 3-seat bench in the rear and 2 single seats in the front. The design features a foldable bed that uses the back of the 3-seat bench as the middle support for the bed.

I tried to provide the correct measurements, but I'm still "building" the inside, so some pieces may need to be adjusted.

This is the bed.
